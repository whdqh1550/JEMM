Short description:
Hotel Management App will prove useful to hotels in keeping track of hotel information and making the booking procress simple. The app will display a home page where occupied rooms will show in a table and a pie chart will show total hotel availability. There will be several windows to change to, one being the calendar view where the user can see how occupied the hotel is by a monthly view. Another window is the search window that allows for quick access to information. For example if the user needs to look for the phonenumber of an individual they can enter the room number of the occupant or first name/last name to quickly access the phone number. Lastly the booking window will allow user to book and update information about room occupation with entered details in respective input boxes.
